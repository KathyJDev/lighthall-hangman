# HangMan
This Hangman Game is an interactive word-guessing game. In the main game, users are allowed a hint to help them guess the secret word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's body is drawn until the game is won or lost.
This application lets users create their own words for the game and challenge their friends to guess them.
Additionally, the game features a leaderboard that ranks players based on the number of wins they've accumulated.

This project was made as a submission in the Lighthall Software Engineering Super League 1: Level 3.
